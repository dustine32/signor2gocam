SIGNOR-LBC	Luminal Breast Cancer	FGFR1	receptor	protein	P11362	UNIPROT	FRS2	receptor	protein	Q8WU20	UNIPROT	up-regulates activity	phosphorylation			10116	BTO:0002809								9182757	t		fspada	In this report, we demonstrate that FGF stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a novel lipid anchored docking protein, termed FRS2, that forms a complex with Grb2/Sos, thus linking FGF-receptor activation to the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway.

The insulin receptor substrate-1 (irs-1) is rapidly phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues by the activated insulin receptor. Insulin signals are mediated through tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (irs-1) and shc by the activated insulin receptor (ir).	SIGNOR-236745

Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization and transphosphorylation. Fgfr1 contains eleven tyrosine residues (tyr154, tyr280, tyr307, tyr463, tyr585, tyr605, tyr653, tyr654, tyr730 and tyr766), some of which are directly involved regulating the activity of the receptor and others bind to activate substrates leading to the activation of various transduction pathways.
