SIGNOR-AML	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	2-oxoglutarate(2-)		smallmolecule	CHEBI:16810	ChEBI	TET2		protein	Q6N021	UNIPROT	up-regulates activity	chemical activation			9606									25699704	t		irozzo	A second group of AML patients (15%–33% of all cases) harbor mutations in either the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 gene (Shih et al., 2012). These enzymes produce α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), which is required for TET activity.	SIGNOR-255706
SIGNOR-Hedgehog	Sonic Hedgehog	ADCY1	receptor	protein	Q08828	UNIPROT	3',5'-cyclic AMP		smallmolecule	CHEBI:17489	ChEBI	up-regulates	small molecule catalysis			9606									17251915	t		gcesareni	Typically Gas stimulates adenylyl cyclase and increases levels of cyclic amp (camp), whereas galfai inhibits adenylyl cyclase and lowers camp levels, and members of the galfaq family bind to and activate phospholipase c (plc), which cleaves phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (pip2) into diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate (ip3). The gbeta subunits and ggamma subunits function as a dimer to activate many molecules, including phospholipases, ion channels and lipid kinases.	SIGNOR-152546
